# HackerEarthCode

Here You can the Hacker Earth code solution in python:

1. You are given a table with n rows and m columns. Each cell is colored with white or black. Considering the shapes created by black     cells, what is the maximum border of these shapes? Border of a shape means the maximum number of consecutive black cells in any row    or column without any white cell in between.
   A shape is a set of connected cells. Two cells are connected if they share an edge. Note that no shape has a hole in it.

2. You are provided an array A of size N that contains non-negative integers. Your task is to determine whether the number that is formed by selecting the last digit of all the N numbers is divisible by 10.

3. You are required to enter a word that consists of x and y that denote the number of Zs and Os respectively. The input word is considered similar to word zoo if 2 * x = y.

4. You are given two arrays a1,a2,...,an and b1,b2,...,bn. In each step, you can set ai = ai - bi if ai >= bi. Determine the minimum number of steps that are required to make all a's equal.

5. Bob has a playlist of N songs, each song has a singer associated with it (denoted by an integer). Favourite singer of Bob is the one whose songs are the most on the playlist. Count the number of Favourite Singers of Bob

6. Arpasland has surrounded by attackers. A truck enters the city. The driver claims the load is food and medicine from Iranians. Ali is one of the soldiers in Arpasland. He doubts about the truck, maybe it's from the siege. He knows that a tag is valid if the sum of every two consecutive digits of it is even and its letter is not a vowel. Determine if the tag of the truck is valid or not. We consider the letters "A","E","I","O","U","Y" to be vowels for this problem.
